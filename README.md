# static-site-container
Sometimes there are multiple static sites for testing or development. 
But we don't want to deploy multiple nodejs instances or other production web server like nginx. 
So the static-site-cotnainer will help to handle this.

## Features

 * Support multiple sites on single node instance.
 * Support multiple domains for each site.
 * Support serve static gzipped file by connect-gzip-static.
 * Support folder index page (index.htm or index.html).
 * Support express router (Coming soon).  

## Install
```
$npm install static-site-container -g
```

## Usage
```
$static-site-container --root /multiple-sites-root --port 80
 
```

multiple site folder structure:
```
multiple-sites-root/
    sites/
        www.abc.com/
            site-config.json        
            public/
                index.htm
                ...
        www.xyz.com/
            public/
                index.html
                ...
            
```

## Site Config File

static-site-container will read config file named site-config.json under site folder.

    "port": 80
}

```
